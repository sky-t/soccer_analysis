1. An [analysis](https://github.com/sky-t/soccer_analysis/blob/master/timbers_cb_xga.ipynb) of which Portland Timbers' center back pairings over last 3 years have the best xGA performance (expected goals against). Raw data was provided by the team at [ASA](http://www.americansocceranalysis.com/). If you are unfamiliar with xG, ASA created a helpful [write up](http://www.americansocceranalysis.com/explanation/) on the expected goals metric. A [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sky.t#!/vizhome/timbers_cb_xga/Dashboard1) based on the same data.
2. some [data wrangling](https://github.com/sky-t/soccer_analysis/blob/master/soccer_data_wrangling.ipynb) and reshaping in support of 1 above
